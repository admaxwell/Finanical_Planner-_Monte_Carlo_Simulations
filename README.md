# Finanical Planner Monte Carlo Simulations

The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to produce two finanical analysis tools.

Tool One: A emergency fund finanical planner. This tool will help members to visualize their current savings and then determine if the member has enough money to build an emergercy fund. 

Tool Two: A retirement planner. This tool will forcast the members retirement portfolio at various weights over 30 years using a technology called Monte Carlo.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) - For summary statistics, visulizations, and times series analysis.
* [jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/install) - JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

* Visual Studio Code Version: 1.70.2 (Universal)

## Data Analysis

The monte carlo simulations run in this notebook determine retirement possiblities. With a 10 year simulation a portfolio that is weighted toward stocks a member will not have enough money in their retirement account. However, when the simulation runs a 30 year projection the member can retire in that amount of time. These simulations prove that the more time you have in the market the better the outcome.
